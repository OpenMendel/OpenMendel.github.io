## OpenMendel Project
The main website for the [OpenMendel project](https://openmendel.github.io).

OpenMendel is an open source project implemented in the [Julia](http://julialang.org) programming language
that comprises a set of packages for statistical analysis to solve a variety of genetic problems.
OpenMendel is the open source version of [Mendel](http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software), 
a comprehensive package for exact statistical genetic analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits. OpenMendel currently provides a number of analysis options, with additional options under development. Each analysis option is a separate Julia package. We invite the genetics community to contribute to the OpenMendel Project.
